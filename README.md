# BopBot the Discord bot

This is a bot I developed for my own discord server to cut down the amount of bots in my server. 
Also has a few extras that I wanted from other bots but they didn't have any.

## Getting Started

To run the bot just clone the bot repo and run npm install. After that just change the example API keys of Youtube and BotToken.
Also make sure to change the channel id-s to ones on your server.

### Prerequisites

This bot needs node and npm installed in order for it to function.

If You want the music commands to function you must have ffmpeg installed properly on your system.

## Commands

Use !help to get a list of commands that you can use.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Used as the bot base environment.
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - Node module used to communicate with the Discrod API.
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Used for streaming audio.
* And some other minor dependencies.
