# BopBot the Discord bot

This is a bot I developed for my own discord server to cut down the amount of bots in my server. 
Also has a few extras that I wanted from other bots but they didn't have any.

## Getting Started

To run the bot just clone the bot repo and run npm install. After that just change the example API keys of Youtube and BotToken.
<br/>Also make sure to change the channel id-s to ones on your server.

__Example .env below__ 
```
BOT_TOKEN=NjgyOTE1MjEyODE0NTgxNzkx.XmIApw.6-YIblyNID5W2BSLMmQ-2GZ3G4g 
YOUTUBE_KEY=AIzaSyAki9rSmM28KxJfrKE1R__sngb8jr7IZrA
GUILD_ID = 326463549234872321
MAINCHANNEL_ID=447855854809776134
BOTCHANNEL_ID=446320292642684929
TESTCHANNEL_ID=638001434956136449
ANNOUCEMENT_ID=547529711589261365
```
